Research in it of itself is not a boring task, but there are certainly parts of research that are tedious and boring. 
Finding relevant sources to an investigation is a repetitive task and surprisingly difficult. On top of that, creating bibliography citations is a necessary but monotonous task. Titles of research papers are often misleading or not truly indicative of the content of an article which leads to missed gold and false prophets. 

Papercut is a web application designed to help those in academia to find academic sources most relevant to them, in a more fun and streamlined manner. Papercut aims to increase the efficiency of the source searching workflow.

# Features

Papercut is a search engine for [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) which generates AI summaries of papers while you are searching for sources. Users can then add relevant sources to a list, which organizes them in a clean and efficient way. Afterwards, the useful sources can be formatted into a bibliography, allowing easy integration into research projects.
