Finding relevant sources is a repetitive task and surprisingly difficult. On top of that, creating bibliography citations are a necessary but monotonous task.
Titles of research papers are often misleading or not truly indicative of the content of an article which leads to missed gold and false prophets. 
Papercut aims to simplify and increase the efficiency the source searching workflow.
